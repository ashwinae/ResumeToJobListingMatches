This role is ideal for coders with a strong background in algorithmic thinking, problem design, and hands-on experience with competitive programming platforms. You'll be developing interactive, terminal-based challenges that test the problem-solving capabilities of autonomous agents in real-time coding scenarios. You’re a great fit if you: Have a track record of success in competitive programming contests (e.g., ICPC, Codeforces, LeetCode, AtCoder, HackerRank). Possess strong skills in algorithms, data structures, and systems-level thinking. Are proficient in Python, C++, or Go, and comfortable working in terminal-based coding environments. Can design programming problems that test time complexity, memory constraints, logic correctness, and multi-step reasoning. Have experience with online judge systems, sandboxed environments, or contest infrastructure. Are curious about AI agents and interested in how agents can solve real-world programming tasks. Enjoy creating reproducible, progressive challenges and can abstract real-world systems problems into code-based puzzles. Primary Goal of This Role To create terminal bench–style problems and tasks where autonomous agents are challenged to solve competitive programming problems in a live, terminal-driven environment. These tasks will test agent performance across algorithmic domains — such as graph theory, dynamic programming, greedy techniques, and real-time debugging — and serve as a benchmark for reasoning, adaptability, and correctness under constraints. What You’ll Do Design and implement terminal-based coding challenges for agents to solve autonomously. Build a sandboxed, judge-like environment that runs test cases, checks correctness, and monitors time/memory usage. Simulate real-world competitive conditions: limited time, incremental hints, multiple submissions, etc. Collaborate with AI engineers to define reward functions, failure conditions, and difficulty tiers. Develop tooling for benchmark resets, output validation, and scenario generation. Evolve the difficulty of problems from beginner-level syntax and logic to advanced algorithmic pipelines and systems simulations. Why This Role Is Exciting Define a new generation of programming benchmarks built specifically for AI agents. Blend algorithmic design, problem solving, and systems-level realism in one role. Work on uncharted challenges that push the boundaries of what agents can understand and execute. Pay & Work Structure You’ll be classified as an hourly contractor to Mercor. Paid weekly via Stripe Connect, based on hours logged. Part-time (20 hrs/week) with fully remote, async flexibility — work from anywhere, on your own schedule.

    "raw_text": "General Knowledge Evaluator (MultiChallenge benchmark) Hourly contract Remote $30-$60 per hour Posted by Mercor mercor.com 15 open positions Closing soon Mercor is hiring expert evaluators to support a high-impact reasoning evaluation workflow in partnership with a leading AI research lab. This work centers on the MultiChallenge benchmark, which is designed to test large language models (LLMs) on multi-turn conversational reasoning — a capability where even top models fall short today. This benchmark does not focus on domain-specific expertise, but rather on reasoning consistency, instruction retention, and contextual inference across loosely structured conversations on general topics. What is MultiChallenge? MultiChallenge is a newly released benchmark targeting reasoning failures that occur in multi-turn interactions between humans and LLMs. It evaluates four categories of failure modes: Instruction Retention – Does the model persistently follow instructions across turns? Inference Memory – Can it infer or recall relevant user details from earlier conversation history? Reliable Versioned Editing – Can it revise content through multi-step iteration without forgetting or hallucinating? Self-Coherence – Does it contradict its earlier claims, particularly under user pressure? The benchmark is designed to surface realistic, high-difficulty conversational reasoning challenges. Despite scoring highly on other multi-turn benchmarks, current frontier models achieve less than 50% accuracy on MultiChallenge. Who We're Hiring We are seeking evaluators with strong backgrounds in Logic, Philosophy, or related disciplines — particularly those trained to track argument structure, detect reasoning errors, and evaluate coherence across extended discourse. This workflow is ideal for individuals with academic experience in: Logic Analytic Philosophy Epistemology Formal Semantics Cognitive Science Linguistics (with a reasoning focus) Key Responsibilities Evaluate the reasoning quality of LLM outputs across 8–10 turn conversations. Identify errors in instruction-following, factual coherence, inference, and revision handling. Complete evaluations using a structured rubric and short written justifications. Work asynchronously using provided tools and examples. You’re a Strong Fit If You Have: A PhD (or are currently a PhD candidate) in Logic, Philosophy, or a closely related field. Experience analyzing or writing complex arguments. Excellent written communication and generalist reasoning ability. Comfort working independently and asynchronously. (Optional) Familiarity with Python or LLM evaluation tools is helpful but not required. Role Details Part-time (10–20 hours/week) with flexible scheduling. 100% remote and asynchronous — work from anywhere. Contractor position via Mercor, paid hourly. Competitive rates: $30–$60/hour depending on expertise. Weekly payments processed securely through Stripe Connect.

Ideal fit: Have experience in one or more of these archetypes: technical writers, editors, research analysts, academic editors, content reviewers, legislative analysts, reading‑comprehension specialists, assessment authors, curriculum designers or instructional designers.

Possess strong fact‑checking and editing skills to validate and polish AI‑generated answers. Apply analytical judgment to spot inconsistencies, gaps, or misinterpretations in draft outputs. Communicate crisply in writing, producing clear, concise, well‑structured answers and maintain high attention to detail.

Start dates are rolling; we aim to onboard qualified experts within a few days (1‑2) of application. There is up to 40 hours of work available per week.

Similar to how a human would review a resume, conduct an interview, and decide who to hire, we automate all of those processes with LLMs. Our technology is so effective it’s used by all of the top 5 AI labs. We crossed a $100M revenue run rate and have averaged 59% month over month growth for the last 6 months, making us the fastest growing company in the world. The team is small and we remain extremely profitable because we can’t hire great people as fast as revenue is growing. About the Role As a dedicated recruiter, you will own the full‑cycle hiring process across every function—engineering, machine learning, product, go‑to‑market, and operations. You’ll partner directly with the founders and senior leaders to build the teams that fuel Mercor’s next phase of hyper‑growth. Your north‑star metric is straightforward: hire mission‑critical talent fast—without compromising on quality. This role reports to the Chief Operating Officer. Key Responsibilities Own the full recruiting funnel: creative sourcing, screening, interviews, closing, and onboarding. Leverage Mercor’s proprietary LLM tools to triage applicants and predict quality‑of‑hire; continuously feed hiring data back to the product team. Partner with founders & VPs to forecast headcount, define scorecards, and execute hiring plans. Design and iterate scalable processes (ATS workflows, structured interviews, decision rubrics) that maintain a low time‑to‑hire while raising our hiring bar. Build a magnetic employer brand: craft job ads, social content, events, and outreach campaigns that attract top talent worldwide. Track and report recruiting KPIs (time‑to‑hire, pass‑through rates, diversity metrics, new‑hire productivity) and surface insights to leadership weekly. What We’re Looking For 2–5 + years of full‑cycle recruiting experience in fast‑growing tech, venture‑backed startups, or top search firms. Demonstrated success filling technical and business roles at pace. Exceptional communicator & closer—you can pitch Mercor’s mission, negotiate offers, and build rapport with executives and junior candidates alike. Bias for action and willingness to work 5 days per week (we move at start‑up speed). Compensation & Perks Performance Bonus: significant cash and equity tied to hiring targets Equity Grant: generous initial grant, 4‑year vest with 1‑year cliff. Health: full medical, dental, and vision coverage Why Mercor? You’ll recruit elite talent to build a product that reinvents how every company in the world hires. You’ll have autonomy, resources, and bleeding‑edge AI tools at your disposal—and you’ll see your hires’ impact on revenue within days, not quarters. We consider all qualified applicants without regard to legally protected characteristics and provide reasonable accommodations upon request.",

You’ll work on one of the most intellectually rigorous challenges in AI alignment: helping models reason clearly and fairly about politically sensitive, socially complex, and ideologically charged topics. This role is ideal for individuals who blend strong evidence-based reasoning with the courage to challenge social orthodoxy — those who, like Galileo, can stand by clear evidence even when it defies prevailing consensus. Job Details: Bias & Reasoning Analysis: Evaluate and critique political reasoning produced by AI models, identifying both overt and subtle forms of bias or ideological assumptions. Guide the development of politically neutral, robust frameworks for addressing controversial or culturally sensitive issues. Offer structured feedback on AI outputs to help align them with evidence-based, critical analysis — not social popularity. Collaborate with researchers to help models reason clearly across political spectrums without slipping into dogma or relativism. Ideal Backgrounds: We welcome applicants from diverse intellectual traditions, particularly those who can demonstrate a track record of independent thought and rigorous analysis. Ideal candidates might include: Contrarian intellectuals with the courage and clarity to speak truths that defy groupthink, especially when backed by data, history, or rigorous reasoning PhDs in social sciences (e.g., political science, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy) Historians, anthropologists, or scholars who’ve studied political systems, cultural ideologies, or historical propaganda Independent writers or thinkers with demonstrated ability to dissect bias and present nuanced, evidence-based arguments What We’re Looking For: Mastery of critical thinking, logical reasoning, and source evaluation Comfort operating in controversial or ideologically diverse contexts Ability to write clearly, concisely, and persuasively Intellectual integrity — someone who prioritizes truth over trend Additional Details: This is a remote role Flexible commitment: expect ~20–30 hours per week Structured project environment with clear deliverables and collaborative feedback Pay is negotiable for exceptional candidates Application Process: Submit a resume, CV, or portfolio of relevant writing or research. Complete a short evaluative writing excercise.

    "raw_text": "General Knowledge Evaluator (MultiChallenge benchmark) - India Hourly contract Remote $20-$35 per hour Posted by Mercor mercor.com 20 open positions Closing soon Mercor is hiring expert evaluators to support a high-impact reasoning evaluation workflow in partnership with a leading AI research lab. This work centers on the MultiChallenge benchmark, which is designed to test large language models (LLMs) on multi-turn conversational reasoning — a capability where even top models fall short today. This benchmark does not focus on domain-specific expertise, but rather on reasoning consistency, instruction retention, and contextual inference across loosely structured conversations on general topics. What is MultiChallenge? MultiChallenge is a newly released benchmark targeting reasoning failures that occur in multi-turn interactions between humans and LLMs. It evaluates four categories of failure modes: Instruction Retention – Does the model persistently follow instructions across turns? Inference Memory – Can it infer or recall relevant user details from earlier conversation history? Reliable Versioned Editing – Can it revise content through multi-step iteration without forgetting or hallucinating? Self-Coherence – Does it contradict its earlier claims, particularly under user pressure? The benchmark is designed to surface realistic, high-difficulty conversational reasoning challenges. Despite scoring highly on other multi-turn benchmarks, current frontier models achieve less than 50% accuracy on MultiChallenge. Who We're Hiring We are seeking evaluators with strong backgrounds in Logic, Philosophy, or related disciplines — particularly those trained to track argument structure, detect reasoning errors, and evaluate coherence across extended discourse. This workflow is ideal for individuals with academic experience in: Logic Analytic Philosophy Epistemology Formal Semantics Cognitive Science Linguistics (with a reasoning focus) Key Responsibilities Evaluate the reasoning quality of LLM outputs across 8–10 turn conversations. Identify errors in instruction-following, factual coherence, inference, and revision handling. Complete evaluations using a structured rubric and short written justifications. Work asynchronously using provided tools and examples. You’re a Strong Fit If You Have: A PhD (or are currently a PhD candidate) in Logic, Philosophy, or a closely related field. Experience analyzing or writing complex arguments. Excellent written communication and generalist reasoning ability. Comfort working independently and asynchronously. (Optional) Familiarity with Python or LLM evaluation tools is helpful but not required. Role Details Part-time (10–20 hours/week) with flexible scheduling. 100% remote and asynchronous — work from anywhere. Contractor position via Mercor, paid hourly. Competitive rates: $20–$35/hour depending on expertise. Weekly payments processed securely through Stripe Connect.

This role is part of a specialized team supporting a high-impact Code Review project, and is ideal for engineers with deep expertise navigating and reasoning about very large software repositories across multiple programming languages. You’ll work to push the boundaries of automated understanding, reasoning, and decision-making in massive, real-world codebases. Your contributions will support the development and evaluation of next-generation AI agents capable of reviewing and reasoning about complex software systems. You’re a great fit if you: Have significant experience working with large-scale codebases – e.g., repositories the size of DataHub, PyTorch, or larger. Have deep familiarity with one or more programming languages, with preference for Java, Kotlin, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Python. Are comfortable reasoning about multi-language, multi-module architectures with complex dependency graphs, CI/CD integrations, and modularized designs. Have strong intuition for code quality, design patterns, architectural tradeoffs, and common pitfalls in large codebases. Are skilled at breaking down, analyzing, and navigating massive repositories efficiently and systematically. Are excited about building or supporting systems that help AI agents perform tasks like code review, refactoring, and reasoning across large repos. Primary Goal of This Role To support the development of intelligent agent systems by providing expert-level insight into the structure, dependencies, and semantics of large-scale software repositories. You’ll work with research engineers to design tasks, datasets, and evaluation frameworks that challenge agents to understand, reason about, and improve complex real-world codebases.

About Mercor Mercor is training models that predict how well someone will perform on a job better than a human can. Similar to how a human would review a resume, conduct an interview, and decide who to hire, we automate all of those processes with LLMs. Our technology is so effective it’s used by all of the top 5 AI labs. We crossed a $100M revenue run rate and have averaged 59% month over month growth for the last 6 months, making us the fastest growing company in the world. The team is small, and we remain extremely profitable because we can’t hire great people as fast as revenue is growing. We consider all qualified applicants without regard to legally protected characteristics and provide reasonable accommodations upon request.",

Our Talent Success team is responsible for ensuring everyone using our platform is having a delightful experience end to end, from applying to job listings, taking our AI-led interviews, accepting offers on our platform, and getting paid for their hard work. About the Role Mercor has thousands of users joining the platform each week to interview for different roles our clients have posted. When they run into issues or have questions and reach out for help, you will be responsible for giving them a speedy and delightful experience. You will work directly with our engineering team, triaging and investigating bug reports so being super savvy with modern websites and issues SaaS-type applications run into will come in handy. Since your conversations with the talent applying on our platform will often be the first interaction someone has with Mercor, maintaining an enthusiastic, upbeat tone while writing at native English level proficiency is important. We use a lighthearted and informal tone in our support communication while at the same time being very professional and precise in our replies. Key Responsibilities Respond to support requests from Mercor’s talent pool who have a question or issue applying for roles on our platform Triage and investigate talent-reported issues. Identify redundancies and plan-execute-monitor day to day talent success workflows for improving experience for our talent where it matters the most. Proactively identify and document recurring user pain points/issues, sharing actionable insights with product and engineering teams to reduce support volume and improve self-serve experiences Build talent-facing documentation to answer common questions we get in our support queue Advocate for our users internally—help shape the product by championing their feedback and needs. Maintain enthusiasm and positivity while writing replies in near-perfect English Qualifications 1–3 years of experience in customer success, operations, or product support in a SaaS or marketplace environment Strong communication and problem-solving skills, with a proven ability to de-escalate issues and keep users happy. Experience using a support platform (like Zendesk, Intercom, Help Scout, Freshdesk, Crisp) Natural product intuition—you notice friction points, think through solutions, and can articulate them clearly to non-support teams Comfort working cross-functionally to drive resolutions through process or product improvements rather than manual fixes At Mercor, we recognize that exceptional ability comes in all forms, a core philosophy on which we built our platform. Because of this, we welcome candidates from diverse backgrounds with unique experiences and transferable skill sets, even if they don't meet all the preferred qualifications listed above. About Mercor Mercor is training models that predict how well someone will perform on a job better than a human can. Similar to how a human would review a resume, conduct an interview, and decide who to hire, we automate all of those processes with LLMs. Our technology is so effective it’s used by all of the top 5 AI labs. We crossed a $100M revenue run rate and have averaged 59% month over month growth for the last 6 months, making us the fastest growing company in the world. The team is small, and we remain extremely profitable because we can’t hire great people as fast as revenue is growing.
